            <li>Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage
                (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.[1] The term is
                generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet.[2] Large clouds,
                predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the
                connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server. Clouds may be limited
                to a single organization (enterprise clouds[3][4]), or be available to multiple organizations (public
                cloud). Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale.

        <li id="blockchain">Blockchain</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A blockchain,[1][2][3] originally block chain,[4][5] is a growing list of records, called blocks, that
                are
                linked using cryptography.[1][6] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,[6] a
                timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree). By design, a blockchain is
                resistant to modification of its data. This is because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot
                be
                altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks. For use as a distributed ledger, a
                blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for
                inter-node
                communication and validating new blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains
                may be
                considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault
                tolerance. The blockchain has been described as "an open, distributed ledger that can record
                transactions
                between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".</li>

        <li id="internet-of-think">Internet of Thing</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The Internet of things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with
                sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other
                devices and systems over the Internet. The definition of the Internet of things has evolved due to the
                convergence of multiple technologies, real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and
                embedded systems.[1] Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems,
                automation (including home and building automation), and others all contribute to enabling the Internet
                of things.[5] In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the
                concept of the "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats,
                home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common
                ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and
                smart speakers. IoT can also be used in healthcare systems.[6] There are a number of serious concerns
                about dangers in the growth of IoT, especially in the areas of privacy and security, and consequently
                industry and governmental moves to address these concerns have begun including the development of
                international standards..</li>

        Sir Muhammad Iqbal (Urdu: محمد اقبال; 9 November 1877-21 April 1938) was a poet and politician from Punjab,
        British India (now in Pakistan), whose poetry in Urdu, Punjabi and Persian is considered to be among the
        greatest of the modern era,[1] and whose vision of an independent state for the Muslims of British India was to
        inspire the creation of Pakistan. He is commonly referred to as Allama Iqbal (علامہ اقبال, Allama lit.
        Scholar). After studying in England and Germany, Iqbal established a law practice, but concentrated primarily on
        writing scholarly works on politics, economics, history, philosophy and religion. He is best known for his
        poetic works, including Asrar-e-Khudi—which brought a knighthood— Rumuz-e-Bekhudi, and the Bang-e-Dara. In Iran,
        where he is known as Iqbāl-e Lāhorī (Urdu: اقبال لاہوری, Punjabi: اقبال لہوری Iqbal of Lahore), he is highly
        regarded for his Persian works. Iqbal was a strong proponent of the political and spiritual revival of Islamic
        civilisation across the world, but specifically in India; a series of famous lectures he delivered to this
        effect were published as The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam. One of the most prominent leaders of
        the All India Muslim League, Iqbal encouraged the creation of a "state in northwestern India for Indian Muslims"
        in his 1930 presidential address.[2] Iqbal encouraged and worked closely with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and he is
        known as Muffakir-e-Pakistan ("The Thinker of Pakistan"), Shair-e-Mashriq ("The Poet of the East"), and
        Hakeem-ul-Ummat ("The Sage of Ummah"). He is officially recognised as the "national poet" in Pakistan. The
        anniversary of his birth (یوم ولادت محمد اقبال Yōm-e Welādat-e Muḥammad Iqbāl) on 9 November is a holiday in
        Pakistan. Mohammad Iqbal was born on 9 November 1877 in Sialkot, in the Punjab province of British India in what
        is now Pakistan. During the reign of Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan—according to scholar Bruce Lawrence—Iqbal's
        Brahmin ancestors from Kashmir had converted to Islam.[3] However, according to Iqbal biographer Mustansir Mir,
        the conversion to Islam took place even earlier, some four and a half centuries before Iqbal's birth.[4] Much
        later, around the turn of the nineteenth century, as the Kashmir region came under Sikh rule, his grandfather's
        family emigrated to the Punjab.[4] According to scholar Annemarie Schimmel, Iqbal often wrote about his being "a
        son of Kashmiri-Brahmans but (being) acquainted with the wisdom of Rumi and Tabriz."[5] Iqbal's father, Nur
        Muhammad, was a tailor,[4] who lacked formal education, but who had great devotion to Islam and a "mystically
        tinged piety."[5] Iqbal's mother was known in the family as a "wise, generous woman who quietly gave financial
        help to poor and needy women and arbitrated in neighbor's disputes.</p>

    <h3>MUHAMMAD ALI JINAH (R.A)</h3>
    <p><img src="./assets/Quaide-azam.jpeg" width="200" height="200" align="Right" />
        Muhammad Ali Jinnah (born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a barrister,
        politician
        and the founder of Pakistan.[2] Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until
        Pakistan's independence on 14 August 1947, and then as Pakistan's first Governor-General until his death. He is
        revered in Pakistan as Quaid-i-Azam ("Great Leader") and Baba-i-Qaum, ("Father of the Nation"). His birthday is
        a
        national holiday in Pakistan. Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's
        In in London. Upon his return to British India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in
        national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian
        National
        Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah
        advocated
        Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League,
        in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All India Home Rule League, and
        proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims. In 1920,
        however, Jinnah
        resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political
        anarchy. By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that Muslims of the Indian subcontinent should have their own state
        to avoid the possible marginalised status they may gain in a Hindu-Muslim state. In that year, the Muslim
        League,
        led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation. During the Second World War, the
        League
        gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the elections held shortly after the war,
        it won
        most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a
        power-sharing formula for the subcontinent to be united as a single state, leading all parties to agree to the
        independence of
        a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan. As the first Governor-General of
        Pakistan,Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and policies, and to aid the millions of Muslim
        migrants
        who had emigrated from the new nation of India to Pakistan after independence, personally supervising the
        establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948, just over a year after Pakistan gained
        independence
        from the United Kingdom. He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan. Innumerable streets, roads and
        localities
        in the world are named after Jinnah. Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's name.
        According to his biographer, Stanley Wolpert, Jinnah remains Pakistan's greatest leader.</p>

        that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as
        protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as
        the 7th century BC,[2] with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first
        emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[3] Later on, many successive dynasties have built and
        maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming
        dynasty (1368–1644) </p>

                        locations from central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be
                        designated an edge server. Clouds may be limited to a single organization (enterprise
                        clouds[3][4]), or be available to multiple organizations (public cloud). Cloud computing relies

                        tree). By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of its data. This is because once
